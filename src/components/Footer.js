       <p>Absolutely recommend Jim Meade—he knows the trade inside and out and is 100% fair. 
        He gave great feedback on my ideas and made suggestions to improve my basement within budget.
         He gave multiple options after seeing my space but let me decide what choices to pursue. 
         Communicated clearly the time frame and cost for the project. I’ll be calling him for any 
         future plumbing needs!</p>

        Jim has been awesome to work with. He's helped us with our new home construction, 
        and we've changed our minds about 15 times. We went from tank to tankless, non re-circ to re-circ, 
        etc. Jim educated us on what he'd do, how to build to last, etc. He was constantly updating us on his
         schedule, and willing to work with our changes. He's been honest and reliable and we can't wait 
         to have him back in a year or two to finish our basement. Thanks, Jim!

        My meeting Jim for my bathroom remodel has been a fantastic experience every step of the way. 
        Not only did he do excellent work himself, he was a great resource in recommending other great 
        trades - electrical, framing, drywall, tile work - and they were all as professional and excellent 
        value as he was. He has an excellent team of trades he works with.
